## Conditionals

### ZERO CONDITIONAL

General truth and general habits

(if + present simple, ... present simple)
If you heat water to 100 degrees, it boils.



### FIRST CONDITIONAL

Possible or likely things in the future

(If + present simple, will + infinitive)

If you go to London you will see loads of people



### SECOND CONDITIONAL

Impossible things in the present / unlikely things in the future. Can be used for advices

(If + past simple, would + infinitive)

If I had a lot of money, I would travel around the world.



### THIRD CONDITIONAL

Things that didn't happen it the past and their imaginary results

(If + past perfect, would + have + past participle)

If I hadn't overslept I wouldn't have been late for the meeting



### MIXED CONDITIONAL

It is possible for the two parts of a conditional sentence to refer to different times, and the resulting sentence is a "mixed conditional" sentence. There are two types of mixed conditional sentence.

**Present result of a past condition**

###### Form

In this type of mixed conditional sentence, the tense in the 'if' clause is the past perfect, and the tense in the main clause is the present conditional.

| If clause (condition)      | Main clause (result)     |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| If + past perfect          | present conditional      |
| If this thing had happened | that thing would happen. |

As in all conditional sentences, the order of the clauses is not fixed. You may have to rearrange the pronouns and adjust punctuation when you change the order of the clauses, but the meaning is identical.

##### Examples

- If I had worked harder at school, I would have a better job now.
- I would have a better job now if I had worked harder at school.
- If we had looked at the map we wouldn't be lost.
- We wouldn't be lost if we had looked at the map.
- If you had caught that plane you would be dead now.
- You would be dead now if you had caught that plane.

###### Function

This type of mixed conditional refers to an unreal past condition and its probable result in the present. These sentences express a situation which is contrary to reality both in the past and in the present. In these mixed conditional sentences, the time is the **past** in the "if" clause and in the **present** in the main clause.

##### Examples

- If I had studied I would have my driving license. (but I didn't study and now I don't have my license)
- I would be a millionaire now if I had taken that job. (but I didn't take the job and I'm not a millionaire)
- If you had spent all your money, you wouldn't buy this jacket. (but you didn't spend all your money and now you can buy this jacket)

In these mixed conditional sentences, you can also use modals in the main clause instead of *would* to express the degree of certainty, permission, or a recommendation about the outcome.

##### Examples

- If you had crashed the car, you might be in trouble.
- I could be a millionaire now if I had invested in ABC Plumbing.
- If I had learned to ski, I might be on the slopes right now.

#### Past result of present or continuing condition

###### Form

In this second type of mixed conditional sentence, the tense in the 'if' clause is the simple past, and the tense in the main clause is the perfect conditional.

| If clause (condition)  |      Main clause (result)       |
| :--------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
|  **If + simple past**  |     **perfect conditional**     |
| If this thing happened | that thing would have happened. |

As in all conditional sentences, the order of the clauses is not fixed. You may have to rearrange the pronouns and adjust punctuation when you change the order of the clauses, but the meaning is identical.



##### Examples

- If I wasn't afraid of spiders, I would have picked it up.
- I would have picked it up if I wasn't afraid of spiders.
- If we didn't trust him we would have sacked him months ago.
- We would have sacked him months ago if we didn't trust him.
- If I wasn't in the middle of another meeting, I would have been happy to help you.
- I would have been happy to help you if I wasn't in the middle of another meeting.



These mixed conditional sentences refer to an unreal present situation and its probable (but unreal) past result. In these mixed conditional sentences, the time in the if clause is **now or always** and the time in the main clause is **before now**. For example, "If I wasn't afraid of spiders" is contrary to present reality. I am afraid of spiders. "I would have picked it up" is contrary to past reality. I didn't pick it up.

##### Examples

- If she wasn't afraid of flying she wouldn't have travelled by boat.
- I'd have been able to translate the letter if my Italian was better.
- If I was a good cook, I'd have invited them to lunch.
- If the elephant wasn't in love with the mouse, she'd have trodden on him by now.



## Future Perfect / Continuous

### FUTURE PERFECT

**(Will + have + past participle)**

- Most people <u>will have installed</u>.
- Cars that use a lot of petrol <u>will have been</u> banned
- Temperatures worldwide <u>will have risen</u>

We use the FUTURE PERFECT to show that an action will have been completed by a specific point in the future

This action is expected to be finished at a specific date

- I <u>will have finished</u> dinner by 7:30 pm.



### FUTURE CONTINOUS

**(Will + be + verb + -ing)**

- People <u>will be recycling</u> at lot more in 2030.
- People <u>will be driving</u> electric cars more next year.
- We <u>will be having</u> more extreme weather, in the next decade.

We use it to show an action will be in progress at a specific time in the future.

- Don’t call me at 1:30 as <u>I’ll  be attending</u> a meeting.

**QUESTION FORMATION AND INDIRECT QUESTIONS:**

1. <u>Should</u> we <u>get</u> a drink? (Should — modal verb, get — auxiliary verb)

   <u>Could</u> we <u>buy</u> it?

2. Why <u>didn’t you</u> like the movie? (use a negative question to show surprise — when someone disagrees with us)

   Isn’t she lovely? (Use a negative question when we expect someone agree with us)

3. What are they talking <u>about</u>? (Put the preposition at the end of the sentence)

4. <u>Who</u> lines in that house? (When then subject of the question is “who”, don’t use do or did)

## PRESENT PERFECT SIMPLE AND PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS

Present perfect simple -has / have + past participle - action and state verbs

Present perfect continuous - has / have + been + verb-ing - only for action verbs



- I have lived here for 10 years

Have + past participle — started in the pst and continuous now

- I have been lining in London for a decade

Have + been + verb-ing -an action that started in the past and continues now

- My skin is red because I have been sunbathing all day without cream

Present perfect continuous — when we want to show the consequence of an action

- I have just cooked diner

Present perfect simple — the action is finished but the result of the action remain

- I have know her for 6 months

Present perfect simple — for state verbs -know / like / hate

We can usr action verbs like “work” in both the present perfect and continuous

- She has worked here since July 
- She’s been worked here since July

(Same meaning, started in the past and continuous now)

- She’s worked here for 2 months
- She been working here for 2 months



We don’t use state verbs with the present perfect continuous

- She’s known him for w months
- ~~She’s been knowing him for 2 month~~ 



2. Your mother has phoned three tomes this morning = use PPS when we say how many times the person has called

3. The kids are exhausted — they’re been running around all day.   use PPC when action has finished but we can see the result of the action

   We use the present perfect continuous to say the action is finished but the consequences of the action are still active and visible

   PPC links the past the past to the present even though the action is finished

4. Tim and Lucy haven’t seen our new house — use PPS -when we talk about that can only happen once, and 



7. Bill has just gone to work
