# Past Simple

Objective: By the end of this lesson, students will be able to identify and use regular and irregular past tense forms in English correctly.

## Introduction:

Most English verbs form the past tense by adding -ed to the base form.
Examples:

-   call → called<br>
-   like → liked<br>
-   want → wanted<br>
-   work → worked<br>
    However, English also has a number of irregular verbs that do not follow this pattern.

## Usage of Past Tense:

We use the past tense to talk about:

A Specific Event in the Past:
Example: "I **met** my wife in 1983."<br>
Repeated Actions in the Past:<br>
Example: "When I **was** a boy, I **walked** a mile to school every day."<br>
A Continued Truth in the Past:<br>
Example: "I **lived** abroad for ten years."<br>
Using 'Ago' with Past Simple:<br>

## The word "ago" is often used with the past simple tense to indicate how far back in the past something happened.

Example: "I met my wife a long time **ago**."
