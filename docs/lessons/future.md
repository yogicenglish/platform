# Future

When we know about the future, we normally use the present tense.

We use the present simple for something scheduled:</br> 

- We have a lesson next Monday.</br> 
- The train arrives at 6.30 in the morning.</br>
- The holidays start next week.</br>
- It's my birthday tomorrow.</br>

We can use the present continuous for plans or arrangements:</br> 

- I'm playing football tomorrow.</br> 
- They are coming to see us tomorrow.</br> 
- We're having a party at Christmas.</br> 

We use will:

when we express beliefs about the future:</br> 
- It will be a nice day tomorrow.</br> 
- I think Brazil will win the World Cup.</br>
- I'm sure you will enjoy the film.</br>

to mean want to or be willing to:</br> 
- I hope you will come to my party.</br>
- George says he will help us.</br> 

to make offers and promises:</br> 
- I'll see you tomorrow.</br> 
- We'll send you an email.</br>

to talk about offers and promises:</br> 
- Tim will be at the meeting.</br> 
- Mary will help with the cooking.</br> 

We use be going to:

to talk about plans or intentions:</br> 
- I'm going to drive to work today.</br> 
- They are going to move to Manchester.</br> 

to make predictions based on evidence we can see:</br> 
- Be careful! You are going to fall. (= I can see that you might fall.)</br> 
- Look at those black clouds. I think it's going to rain. (= I can see that it will rain.)</br> 

## The future in time clauses and if-clauses

In time clauses with words like when, after, until we often use present tense forms to talk about the future:

- I'll come home when I finish work.</br>
- You must wait here until your father comes.</br>
- They are coming after they have had dinner.</br> 

In clauses with if we often use present tense forms to talk about the future:

- We won't be able to go out if it is raining.</br> 
- If Barcelona lose tomorrow, they will be champions.</br> 

## But careful!

Although we do not normally use will in time clauses and if-clauses:

- I'll come home when I finish work. (NOT will finish work)</br>
- We won’t be able to go out if it rains. (NOT will rain)</br> 

but we can use will if it means want to or be willing to:

- I will be very happy if you will come to my party.</br> 
- We should finish the job early if George will help us.</br>
