# Future

When we know about the future, we normally use the present tense.

We use the present simple for something scheduled:</br>

-   We have a lesson next Monday.</br>
-   The train arrives at 6.30 in the morning.</br>
-   The holidays start next week.</br>
-   It's my birthday tomorrow.</br>

We can use the present continuous for plans or arrangements:</br>

-   I'm playing football tomorrow.</br>
-   They are coming to see us tomorrow.</br>
-   We're having a party at Christmas.</br>

We use will:

when we express beliefs about the future:</br>

-   It will be a nice day tomorrow.</br>
-   I think Brazil will win the World Cup.</br>
-   I'm sure you will enjoy the film.</br>

to mean want to or be willing to:</br>

-   I hope you will come to my party.</br>
-   George says he will help us.</br>

to make offers and promises:</br>

-   I'll see you tomorrow.</br>
-   We'll send you an email.</br>

to talk about offers and promises:</br>

-   Tim will be at the meeting.</br>
-   Mary will help with the cooking.</br>

We use be going to:

to talk about plans or intentions:</br>

-   I'm going to drive to work today.</br>
-   They are going to move to Manchester.</br>

to make predictions based on evidence we can see:</br>

-   Be careful! You are going to fall. (= I can see that you might fall.)</br>
-   Look at those black clouds. I think it's going to rain. (= I can see that it will rain.)</br>

## The future in time clauses and if-clauses

In time clauses with words like when, after, until we often use present tense forms to talk about the future:

-   I'll come home when I finish work.</br>
-   You must wait here until your father comes.</br>
-   They are coming after they have had dinner.</br>

In clauses with if we often use present tense forms to talk about the future:

-   We won't be able to go out if it is raining.</br>
-   If Barcelona lose tomorrow, they will be champions.</br>

## But careful!

Although we do not normally use will in time clauses and if-clauses:

-   I'll come home when I finish work. (NOT will finish work)</br>
-   We wonâ€™t be able to go out if it rains. (NOT will rain)</br>

but we can use will if it means want to or be willing to:

-   I will be very happy if you will come to my party.</br>
-   We should finish the job early if George will help us.</br>
