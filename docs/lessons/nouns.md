# Nouns


## Count nouns

Count nouns have two forms: singular and plural.

Singular count nouns refer to one person or thing:

a teacher	
a book	
a wish	
an idea

Plural count nouns refer to more than one person or thing:

teachers	
books	
wishes	
ideas

Singular count nouns
Singular count nouns cannot be used alone. They must have a determiner:

the English teacher <br> 	
that book	
a wish	
my latest idea

Plural count nouns
We usually add –s to make a plural noun:

book	>	books <br>
school	>	schools <br>
friend	>	friends <br> 
We add –es to nouns ending in –s, –ch, –sh, –ss, –x and –o:  

class	>	classes <br>
watch	>	watches <br> 
gas	>	gases <br> 
wish	>	wishes <br> 
box	>	boxes <br> 
potato	>	potatoes <br> 
When a noun ends in a consonant and –y, we make the plural with –ies:

lady	>	ladies <br> 
country	>	countries <br> 
party	>	parties <br> 
If a noun ends in a vowel and –y, we simply add –s:

boy	>	boys <br> 
day	>	days <br> 
play	>	plays <br> 
Some common nouns have irregular plurals:

man	>	men <br> 
woman	>	women <br> 
child	>	children <br> 
person	>	people <br> 
foot	>	feet <br>

Plural count nouns do not have a general determiner when they refer to people or things in general:

Computers are very expensive. <br>
Do you sell old books? <br> 
But they may have a specific determiner:

Those computers are very expensive. <br> 
The books in that shop are very expensive. <br> 
Her sisters live there. <br> 
or a quantifier:

some new books	<br> 
a few teachers	<br> 
lots of good ideas <br> 

or a numeral:

two new books <br> 
three wishes
