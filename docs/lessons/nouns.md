# Nouns

## Count nouns

Count nouns have two forms: singular and plural.

Singular count nouns refer to one person or thing:

a teacher
a book
a wish
an idea

Plural count nouns refer to more than one person or thing:

teachers
books
wishes
ideas

Singular count nouns
Singular count nouns cannot be used alone. They must have a determiner:

the English teacher <br>
that book
a wish
my latest idea

Plural count nouns
We usually add –s to make a plural noun:

book > books <br>
school > schools <br>
friend > friends <br>
We add –es to nouns ending in –s, –ch, –sh, –ss, –x and –o:

class > classes <br>
watch > watches <br>
gas > gases <br>
wish > wishes <br>
box > boxes <br>
potato > potatoes <br>
When a noun ends in a consonant and –y, we make the plural with –ies:

lady > ladies <br>
country > countries <br>
party > parties <br>
If a noun ends in a vowel and –y, we simply add –s:

boy > boys <br>
day > days <br>
play > plays <br>
Some common nouns have irregular plurals:

man > men <br>
woman > women <br>
child > children <br>
person > people <br>
foot > feet <br>

Plural count nouns do not have a general determiner when they refer to people or things in general:

Computers are very expensive. <br>
Do you sell old books? <br>
But they may have a specific determiner:

Those computers are very expensive. <br>
The books in that shop are very expensive. <br>
Her sisters live there. <br>
or a quantifier:

some new books <br>
a few teachers <br>
lots of good ideas <br>

or a numeral:

two new books <br>
three wishes
