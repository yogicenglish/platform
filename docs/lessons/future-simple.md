# Future Simple

Future Simple используется для выражения действий, которые произойдут в будущем. В отличие от других времен, которые имеют множество форм, основанных на нюансах значения, Future Simple в английском языке довольно прямолинейно. В нем используется вспомогательный глагол "will", за которым следует базовая форма основного глагола.

## Formulation

Positive Statements:
Subject + will + base verb + rest of the sentence</br>
Example: She will go to the party tonight.

Negative Statements:
Subject + will + not + base verb + rest of the sentence</br>
Example: They will not (won't) play basketball tomorrow.

Questions:
Will + subject + base verb + rest of the sentence?</br>
Example: Will you join us for dinner?

## Uses

Predictions: When we predict a future event or action. </br>
It will rain tomorrow.</br>
Spontaneous Decisions: Decisions that are made at the moment of speaking.</br>

Promises/Offers/Requests: When we promise to do something or offer/request someone else to do something.</br>

Scheduled Events (less common): Sometimes, especially in public announcements or timetables.</br>
