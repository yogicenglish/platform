Plural count nouns
We usually add –s to make a plural noun:

book	>	books
school	>	schools
friend	>	friends
We add –es to nouns ending in –s, –ch, –sh, –ss, –x and –o:  

class	>	classes
watch	>	watches
gas	>	gases
wish	>	wishes
box	>	boxes
potato	>	potatoes
When a noun ends in a consonant and –y, we make the plural with –ies:

lady	>	ladies
country	>	countries
party	>	parties
If a noun ends in a vowel and –y, we simply add –s:

boy	>	boys
day	>	days
play	>	plays
Some common nouns have irregular plurals:

man	>	men
woman	>	women
child	>	children
person	>	people
foot	>	feet
